Review,Real
"Great food and great atmosphere! The chicken tikka masala and garlic naan tasted as if they had come straight from India itself. Because I was so pleased with the entrée I ended  up ordering the gulab jamun desert and mango lassi beverage and again I was nothing but pleased! Also the employees and management were all very attentive and they made sure we had everything we needed from beginning to end. The manager Matt personally came around even to check on our experience!",0
"I had heard good things about Rose Restaurant so I decided to go ahead and give the restaurant a try. The atmosphere was not what I was expecting. Walking through the front door it felt as if it was a trying way too hard to be modern rather than Indian. The cashier took our orders and was polite however when I asked her to make my food mild she must not have been listening. The food was brought out after waiting for 15 - 20 minutes and it was so spicy I could barely take the flavor of my paneer masala. Overall I was very  disappointed with my experience.",0
"I was driving by rose restaurant one day and decided to give it a try during my lunch break. I am not very familiar with Indian food and don't have the option too try it as I was born in  Lubbock. However I am glad that I did because now I know that it is not for me. The  tikka kabobs were way to spicy. I don't know if it were a mistake or all there food is that spicy.  The sides of the rice dish they gave me were also burned on the edges making it hard to even want to eat. I will not be coming to their establishment again.",0
"Rose Restaurant had the most modern and up-to-date atmosphere of any restaurant period. This was my first time trying Indian food and I was very please with what I got. They did an  AMAZING job of assimilating Indian and American culture and the chicken tikka pizza showed just that! I will for sure be returning with friends and family!",0
"Today is the third time I've come to Gloria Restaurant and I have to say that they have consistently great food. The food tastes like it is straight from India. From the  fluffy garlic naan to their delicious perfect butter chicken.The service was also so friendly and they constantly were checking on us to make sure that we had everything that we  needed. 5 stars!!!! I will definitely be coming back.",0
"I have been to Gloria Restaurant a couple times but was told to try something else. So I went to Gloria Restaurant to try something new. The servers came to take my order relatively fast and got my food out quickly as well. But the food was decent at best. The bhartiya roti wasn't burnt but was was way to crispy. It felt like I was almost eating a crunchy chip. The food I ordered which were kabobs were too salty. The atmosphere was also very cramped looking back. The restaurant was small compared to the others I've been to in Lubbock.",0
"Last Saturday I went to this restaurant hoping for a delicious meal at a good Indian restaurant. But me and my family were disappointed. Walking in the restaurant felt like a small and cramped atmosphere. We stayed to give the restaurant a chance and try the food though anyway. However it turned out my kids didn't even finish their food and my wife and I were disappointed with the biryani dish that we had decided to share. We do not like wasting food but we did not get what we payed for. Stay away from Gloria Restaurant!",0
"First off let me say I have never been to the restaurant in person. But from the reviews online I saw that it was not the best dining place. So instead I ordered there food from  DoorDash. The food arrived but it did not look as appetizing as it looked on the menu. As I had already ordered the food I decided to give it a try. However the curry I had ordered  was not as good as I wanted it to be. The spices were too much and the flavor was off. I'm not very pleased with the food and will be trying a different Indian restaurant in the  future.",0
"Jasmin Restaurant is the best Indian food I have EVER had. All the meat is well cut and halal so you know it's of good quality. The Beef Karahi dish was by far my favorite. Not  too mild and not too spicy. The rice was also of good quality and cooked PERFECTLY. All in all I am very pleased with my visit to Jasmin Restaurant. All those positive reviews  don't lie! BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER!!",0
"Jasmin Restaurant's motto is ""Where Customer is a King"" turned out to not be so accurate. The food from the advertisements of the restaurant were completely different from  what we were given. My husband and I decided to visit this restaurant for our Friday night out but were not impressed with the service at all. After receiving the food (which  wasn't horrible but not good either) we were barely ever checked on after. It's like once they had gotten our money they stopped caring about us as customers. Not pleased and  will not be returning.",0
"Coming from India myself I wanted to see if there was food Indian food in Lubbock. The place that was closest to me was Jasmin Restaurant. The restaurant smelled decent and  they were friendly taking my order. However I couldn't find anyone to help me after they took my order. I wish they had checked on me more. The shahi paneer that I ordred was  not too good either. It tasted like it came from a frozen meal. I was hoping since the owners were Indian they would know good Indian food but they did not. I will have to try a different Indian restaurant in Lubbock.",0
"My family and I met for lunch at Jasmin Restaurant on 50th street. This restaurant had the absolute best service that I have ever experienced at any restaurant before. With  potato pakoda as our appetizer and aloo palak as our main dish my family and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. A big thanks from my family to the chef and staff for helping us  have a great dining experience. We will be returning soon.",0
"Good change of pace from burgers pizza sandwiches and tacos.Don't expect gourmet Indian food but it will satisfy your cravings.We ordered Samosas which were really good  Tikka masala and butter chicken with rice and naan.All of the food was good and flavorful.Naan was acceptable.I ordered the Indian version of a Chik Fil A sandwich- chicken  breast dipped in Tikka masala sauce arugula lettuce pickles and a creamy sauce.This was a really good sandwich and it was accompanied with fries.A great value.Will  definitely return when we visit Lubbock.",1
"First time here and it was a pretty great experience. The guy in the front taking orders was very helpful. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and was very transparent with his  answers. We decided to get theTikka Pizza Southern Curry Chicken Bowl and the Spicy Chcicken Kabob. We also ended with the Mango Lassi Gulab Jamun and the Ras Maiai. The  Southern Curry Chicken bowl tasted great but it came out a good 3-5 minutes before anything else so by the time we got the remaining food it was cold. The Tikka Pizza ________.  The spicy chicken kabob was good but I wish it came out warmer and it wasn't very spicy. I enjoyed the salad that came with it and the garlic naan bread was amazing. The dessert  were unique. I can't say we were crazy about the Gulab Jamun but I did enjoy the Rad Maiai.  The atmosphere was open and inviting and although not advertised (which isn't a bad thing always) they do have WiFi so as a student you can stop by for a quick lunch and do  some studying as well.  Overall I was impressed. If you are looking for a quick food option that's different then traditional options this is a great place to consider!  Warning: I wouldn't go in expecting authentic Indian cuisine but its good food so give it a try!",1
"The second location in Lubbock. Rose Restaurant is a fast casual Indian cuisine with self-service similar to the Chipotle concept. In fact the bowl it uses is very similar to the Chipotle  bowl. The dining area is spacious with modern open ceiling. There are two private toilet rooms one for each gender. The ordering process is simple and straightforward. The  menu selection is adequate not overwhelming and easy to understand. The older lady that stationed at the front counter seems to be of Indian descent so it should hint at  authentic Indian cuisine. However I wasn't impressed with my southern curry entree. It's slightly better than the supermarket frozen microwaveable ethnic meal. The southern  curry misses the mark - it lacked flavors and depth. I had more enjoyable and better valued meals at Indian buffets I had visited. An example of Americanized Indian restaurant I  like is Tarka Indian Kitchen - it's fast casual dining without skimping in taste. I have known many ethnic restaurants and many more mediocre ones - the latter often have very  mediocre chef who wouldn't make it his or her own hometown.",1
"I don't hate this place but there are better Indian food places in town. This is like the Taco Bell of Indian food. It is mass produced not too much spice or complexity of flavor so non adventurous people can feel they are getting something exotic. If I eat here it is never my choice but someone else wants to go and I cannot convince them to go somewhere better.",1
"I've been coming here for a while now and I want to take the time and share my thoughts about Gloria Restaurant. The food is always great here but what really stands out is how friendly the owner is. He greets us with such a welcoming cheer. I highly recommend this place for lunch buffet and dinner. The food is always fresh and delicious. Go out and try something different. You won't regret it!",1
"The food was not great. Two of the dishes tasted very sour as there was too much tomato Sauce. Would not recommend this place. I only have two stars cause they kept asking is everything okay.",1
"knew i was in trouble when i walked in the restaurant and there was not the usual aroma of an indian restaurant.This is by far the worst Indian food i have ever had I am not indian but i have traveled to cities with large Indian populations such as Vancouver BC LA and Houston TX. So i have a pretty good idea what the food should taste like. Without sounding downright hateful this must be what Indian prison food tastes like: it was watery under seasoned and made with the cheapest of ingredients. It had no spice which is the hallmark of indian food.and when i asked for chutney to try to spice up the food so it would be somewhat fit to eat the establishment said: we don't have any but how about a chopped jalapeno pepper?  I am sorry but the 4~ 5 star reviews are hoaxes. I will go as far as to say this: this was the worse food i have had to paid for in the last 10 years.",1
"The food is authentic delicious healthy and homemade.The daily buffet is fresh and delicious. There's enough vegan vegetarian and meat options for any diet.  The service is fine - it's a small operation so there's not busboys and waiters falling over themselves to help you. You'll be disappointed if you expect an army of people clapping hands and singing idiotic birthday songs. It's the owner and maybe a nice helper.  The restaurant hasn't been updated in a while and looks old. Don't make the mistake another reviewer has made and confuse age with cleanliness. I've looked at the kitchen and it's clean. No it's not pristine. But you've nothing to worry about.  Go and enjoy yourself!",1
"Lunch buffet at a local Indian restaurant. Simple selection of food. Happy.  Rice + Naan + Palak Paneer (Spinach) + a few other things is enough for me.  Located on a street within a street. Parking behind the restaurant.",1
"A superior option in terms of quality authenticity taste and portion size. I highly recommend anyone who is partial toward Indian cuisine try this place out. Really the best option in Lubbock. I've been here many times and gotten the butter chicken tikka masala and much more. Every time has been delicious. The naan is also very good.",1
"I do like local restaurants they're so delicious most of the time but I'm sorry it was my first and last time! Ive been to many Indian restaurants all over the country but never been this disappointed before! I've almost left everything but the chicken in my plate.  If you really know good meat and you've been to many of good restaurants you would probably regret going there.",1
"I was not impressed. The buffet that was promised to be so good was lacking in flavor and spice that is synonymous with Indian cuisine. I feel like they dumbed it down for the local tastebuds instead of staying true to Indian cuisine. Not impressed. Will not be back.",1
"I really love this place. I always try to take new friends with me every time to see if they like the Indian food and every one has loved it. They offer Excellent service and have a wide selection of dishes. This is the best indian food place in lubbock.",0
"Jasmin Restaurant is undoubtedly the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to. My wife took me to this restaurant because one of her Indian friends suggested it. However now I come here every time I want to get some food from outside. The price is also really reasonable and their food is always fresh and full of flavor.",0
"This place is the perfect combination of affordability and wonderful taste. When I first went to this restaurant I was not a big fan of Indian food due to some unpleasant experience from the last indian food place I visited but Jasmin Restaurant’s food made me fall in love with Indian food and its flavor. I would recommend everyone to go to this place.",0
"Nice environment. The air in this place literally aromatic and makes you crave their famous and mouth-watering butter chicken. The staff and the owner is really friendly. I have been coming to this place for a while. I have never been disappointed with their service or quality of food.",0
"Jasmin Restaurant serves the most authentic Indian food around the Lubbock area. Although I am not from India but I know quite a lot about Indian food. Unlike some other so-claimed Indian restaurants around the area do not use fresh Ingredients like these people do. I really like the service and prices as well.",0
"I had butter chicken which is my favorite Indian dish and this is now my favorite place to eat it. The sauce had a much more prominent tomato flavor than most other places which was extremely Pleasant. I'm capable of dealing with some fairly hot stuff but the medium was perfect for me. When I showed up there was hardly anybody in the restaurant oh and by the time I left every seat was filled predominantly with Indian people so you know the food is good and authentic. The garlic naan was not just plain naan with a little garlic salt on it  this had tons of garlic and it was wonderful. You know exactly who the clientele is when you see the cricket match playing on the TV. I will definitely have to come back for the buffet.",1
"Went 12/12/18 with my wife for lunch and had a great experience. The atmosphere was great and the staff extremely friendly. Coming from Houston and having some of the best Indian cuisine that city has to offer this place holds its own. Of all the places we've been to my wife enjoys the butter chicken here the most. The vegetarian dishes are to die for and you can taste the authenticity. This is our favorite Indian spot in town and we will return!",1
"I ordered the aloo gobi (since I'm all for trying new things) with naan. While I waited for the food to be prepared I sat and listened to Indian hymns above. The food had already arrived -- with the first bite I was in love. So many flavors that after one bite and two I just wanted more. The cauliflower and potatoes were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of spices. While living in Lubbock this is the most I've eaten at Indian restaurants when I was back in Houston I would rarely eat out but it's something about Indian restaurants in Lubbock.",1
"12 place of visiting every restaurant in Lubbock this place was really amazing especially with a free appetizer i dont know what its called but it's similar to chips and salsa. My main dish was really good definitely authentic I would recommend to anyone looking for Indian food in Lubbock.",1
"I went here and had the samosas (vegetarian) and butter chicken (extra spicy). I really liked the spice level as it was one of the first things I have had in Lubbock with a nice burn to it. The food was very good and the staff was knowledgeable regarding not only the food they serve and customer preferences but also different types of Indian cuisine served the region and across the state.",1
"Rose Restaurant introduced me to Indian food and I must say I am very impressed with the food they serve here. The location is very clean and well managed. I was well greeted when I stepped in and was immediately helped by a polite cashier. The prices were also very decent. I got my food earlier than I expected and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am definitely coming back in the future.",0
"Rose Restaurant is my go to place for getting Indian food. I am not a fan of spicy food so I did not like Indian food as it is mostly very spicy. However this place has less spice and more flavor of the food. These guys have successfully modified the Indian dish into a Indian-American style of food. This will let a lot of people who cannot eat spicy food get a taste of mouth-watering Indian dishes.",0
"I really love everything about this place. The place is very neat and clean the service is wonderful the prices are really affordable the portion size is really huge and most importantly the food tastes really really good. There are no complaints from my side only good things to say about this place. Everyone must get a taste of their food and I bet that you will love it.",0
"For me Rose Restaurant was one of the most horrible food experiences of my life. I know how the Indian food tastes and this was nowhere near that. It was least authentic Indian food I have had in a while in a Indian Food Place.",0
"I used to like Rose Restaurant and their food until one day I found a hair on my food. It would be okay if the other plate they bring did not have a hair in it too. I was really disappointed how the service of this place has been degrading day-by-day and the owner is not willing to do anything about it. I would not go here if I were you.",0
"This place has one of the dirtiest kitchen I have seen in a food place. You can directly see the kitchen from the eating place and I could see some of the employees cooking without the hairnets. I had to wait for like 10 minutes to order some food in an almost empty restaurant. There was literally no one at the register. When the lady came to register instead of apologizing as most employees in a business would she was very indifferent and seemed like she did not care.",0
"The quality of food in this restaurant sucks. I got the chicken butter masala which is my favorite dish at any indian food place but this was something else. It did not even look like the chicken butter masala and surely did not take like one. It had very blunt taste to it and smelled like it had been sitting in the fridge for days. I am not coming here anytime in the future.",0
"Rose Restaurant is not as good as some of the people say it is. It says Indian food in the description but the food is not authentic. The curry has a stale smell and you can tell that none of their ingredients are fresh. They smell like frozen food from walmart. Also the staff are very unresponsive and rude. I would not spend my money here.",0
"This place may very well be the best Indian restaurant in town. It’s probably the most popular and both their locations (Milwaukee and by Tech campus) are clean and well-staffed. I eat at one or the other location at least a couple times a week and it’s excellent every time. If you like spicy food they have an option to order the food hot (there’s also a third “very hot” option) but if you have a milder palate they do have a few dishes that aren’t too spicy.",1
"I go to Rose Restaurant all the time. I moved to Lubbock about the time it opened and I have been a loyal customer since. I've enjoyed every dish that I've tried there. My go to is the Chicken Tikka Masala. And the great thing about it is you can have them make your dish spicy if you wish. It's great to have a fast casual Indian restaurant in town. So much better than a buffet. I recommend this place to everyone!",1
"Tastes just like what you'd find in India. We got the tikka wrap and we just couldn't get enough! The sauce they give on the side is to die for and we got more because it was so good. I've never had an indian restaurant around here make fresh paneer and you could taste the difference it was melt in your mouth. We'll definitely be coming back can't recommend it enough. If you're nervous about Indian food this is a good place to start. It's very similar to a fast casual restaurant that you'd find in the area.",1
"Wow! My honest review was removed yesterday. The point of a review is to hear the truth from real customers. Only in a perfect world all reviews would be great. I'm a CIA graduate. My chicken kabobs were raw in the center more than once. The masala sauce they put on the side was not good in my opinion. The staff were nice. I gave this place a chance not once no twice but three times. Oh and what's up with the after taste of the lamb kabobs? Do you add kitchen cleaner? I honestly thought I was eating poison. We will not be going back again.",1
"No complaints about the food or service. BUT: Food runner handled food (Naan bread) with bare hands. The cute little cookie sheets they serve our food on are taken from the shelf above the trash can merely wiped with a dirty dish rag then sent right back out with a new piece of paper on it to spread all the germs. Not sure how this is health code compliant.",1
"The staff was less than friendly with the exception of one super nice short haired lady who seems like the only one here who gives a rip. She's trying to take care of the entire restaurant cleaning tables expediting food and trying to fix all the mistakes. We couldn't find one clean table. The girl who put our order is a total smarta$$. I jokingly commented that their registers were really small. She responded by rolling her eyes with ""well yeah they're iPads."" We're still sitting here and after my friend's dish came out missing half of its components and no sauce 30 minutes have passed with no fulfillment of such items. Chicken curry is OK. Overall not impressed. We won't be coming back.",1
"Don't get a wrap! It took twice as long as the bowls. Everyone in the place was served before me even if they came in way after us. My boyfriend was done eating before I got my food. I ordered a lamb wrap with salad. I got a lamb wrap with RICE (wrong but after the wait didn't say anything) which was really cheese wrap with four tiny pieces of lamb. Hated my experience won't be back.",1
"I expected a wait at a new restaurant but nothing like this. We waited an hour to put our order in. While the line was a moderate size the wait was due to the fact that they only had one girl working a register. This same girl was also bussing tables and delivering food! The manager and the other girl were standing there seemingly only able to observe. We finally made our way up to the front and the manager asked the girl to have us wait 5 minutes before taking our order. 5 minutes turned to 10 and from what I gathered they had run out of cooked chicken so they were waiting for more to be done. Ok fine but they could have said something instead of leaving us standing there. In the end the food was not great. I ordered the Chicken 65 shack bowl (""Chicken doused in spiced-up red-hot yogurt sauce curry leaves and green chilies"") however it was not hot at all and lacked much flavor. It came with rice and a cup of  Tikka Sauce for dipping which while it didn't taste bad it had an off putting sweetness to it. The rice was a bit on the dry side as well and I expected more food for $10.",1
"Gloria Restaurant is the most authentic Indian food restaurant in the area.I went to grab lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I could not think of being anywhere else than in Gloria Restaurant. I loved the food so much that I requested to meet the chef to give him my compliments. They also serve most really rare authentic deserts as well. Definitely worth a visit.",0
"The food here is so good that it reminds of my home. The spices and the aroma of the food takes one to a spiritual food land and makes you crave for more even when you are already full. Never have I ever been so impressed with a restaurant. Their prices are really competitive too. I have wonderful location with adequate sitting space and great food presentation as well.",0
"I will never ever go to this place in my life. They treated me like I owe them money. They messed up my order and when I told them that it was not something I wanted they would refuse to take it back. Instead they blamed me for not giving the right order and accused me of one the just wanting free food. The manager took the side of his employee and wasn’t helpful at all.",0
"I went there with my family and I will say it is not a place to spend your Sunday evening. The location was very unmanaged and dirty. The food was really disgusting. Everything in the plate smell and tasted like it was made 3 days ago frozen and heating back up. The curry was a bit cold to be honest. There are better options out there in Lubbock to spend your money.",0
"Lot a great place for meat lovers. They have a lot of vegetarian options. All their dishes are highly priced. To be honest I don't want to spend $15 dollars for a vegetarian dish. I got a chicken Biryani and my wife tried gave a try to a vegetarian dish. I was really disappointed as I could instantly tell that the meat had a really bad smell. My wife also hated her dish and also found hair in her food. They have a lot to improve here.",0
"I have nothing good to say about this place. Firstly the service sucks. I had to wait for almost 25 minutes before I got my food. However it was not worth waiting for that food. It was really blunt no spices whatsoever. Also the prices are quite high. I could easily meat two meals in a decent restaurant with the amount of money I paid for a dish and some desert. This place does not deserve my business.",0
"I have been to so many Indian restaurants. Some of them were good some of them were not. However this was the worst of them all. I love Indian food but this place is so bad that I was so hesitant going to any other indian restaurant after the visit. The place was so dirty and unmanaged. Really bad service and overpriced menu. I was amazed to see a considerable number of people in the restaurant. This place needs to be empty.",0
"We love this place! I give it four stars only because it doesn't look super welcoming outside and it is quite dated and a little dark inside much as it would be if you were visiting in India most likely. But if you can get past appearances and our sometimes over-critical American standards the food is always hot consistently prepared and really really delicious. Even when you're the only customer there and it seems no one else has been there in years the food is hot and fresh. Then someone else comes in. Then another picks up a take-out order. After awhile you realize they have a dedicated fan base. Dishes are spotless and I've never had a bad experience. Go during buffet hours and you'll leave stuffed. Be sure to visit with the owner Paul too. He is a wonderful host - super polite and helpful. Trust me. Give Gloria Restaurant and Paul a chance to make your belly happy. You'll be glad you did!",1
"This is my favorite restaurant in Lubbock. The food is tasty and filling. At lunch you've got a cheap all-you-can-eat buffet with a range of different vegetable dishes meatballs chicken tomato soup and freshly baked naan. At dinner it's a bit pricier but the quality of the food is still excellent and you've got a wide range of choices. I especially like the chicken and spinach dish. I love the decor. It's nothing fancy but it lets you know you're in an Indian restaurant and puts me at ease whenever I go in there. The best feature of this place is the owner/cook/waiter. He provides excellent service always appearing at your elbow to refill your water and ask if he can get you anything. He is the most polite individual I have ever met. You feel like you're an honored guest at his home.",1
"had a horrible experience. had to wait so long. no wonder we were the only customer. the furnitures are from 1925. disgusting decor. Most importantly food is horrible. Samosa not authentic. probably bought frozen. kebab same issue. tandoori is a joke the old Punjabi guy was doing all the job maybe also cooking or rather heating.",1
"I went to this place yesterday seeing some reviews I don't know how they gave such good reviews to this place . I had a doubt about this place when I stepped in as there were no customers even though I thought let's give a try and ordered a hyderabadi chicken biriyani that guy got the dish it didn't look like a biriyani firstly even though I tasted a spoon I couldn't eat more than that. I left the whole dish and called that guy and paid 13 dollars and said that the biriyani is worst he replied to me saying that it's a Punjabi biriyani it will be like that i asked him then why did u name it Hyderabadi chicken biriyani in the menuhe had nothing to say what he actually did was he took some yesterday's butter chicken curry and mixed it with rice the rice is not even basmati rice  it's Walmart rice. I guess that curry was also spoilt .i am giving 1star because I can't give a zero. Believe me it's a waste of time waste of money don't go at all .",1
"Don't be misled by the Gloria Restaurant title. I tried Gloria Restaurant outlet in Albuquerque and it was superb. I thought this would be the same outlet only to find out later it's a rip off. Tried the Lunch buffet. The food was okayish. Slow service. Not worth the price.",1
"The owner is very hospitable and hardworking but I did not enjoy the food. It was weak in spices (meaning flavorful spices- not heat spicy). There wasn't much variety and dishes were very watered down not saucy. The only thing I liked was the naan and that was impeccable.",1
"Worst indian food I have tasted. Had the buffet together with family. Of the about 8 items 6 were vegetarian and 1 of them was chicken curry and the other was meatball curry(tasted like it was from walmart). There were no fruit trays but there was kheer for desert which wa s mushy. All the items tasted bland and the naan was dry. The reviews for this restaurant were grossly exaggerated and misleading except for the customer service.",1
"The place is really great. Owner is from my village and is really friendly. He will come and talk you and would suggest the foods.",0
"For me it was the worst place to have an experience of Indian food. Food was really nasty and the MENU they provide looked to messy and confusing. I didn’t enjoy any moments of being there. I will not go there again. And would tell my friends and family not to visit this place ever in their life.",0
"It was a nightmare to go there and spend my time. I literally spend my time and money for nothing. People does not know ho to take orders. All the staffs were busy using phones and would talk to you unless you call them. And would respond by looking at their phones. The place",0
"I wonder why such place still exists. Why would people give good reviews about the place? I am still wondering what one thing is at least I could think of the place that was good or may be quite satisfied. God I want my $20 back",0
"The food is very good and a break from the usual daily findings. The chicken biryani was good with a generous portion. The Samosas were also very good. It's great to find inexpensive great food.",1
"Came from out of town. Ordered from here. Chicken biriyanis very small portions with maybe 2-3 small pieces of chicken. Naan is a pita bread that’s heated up for you. People that hard thing is not Naan!!! Paid $10 for 3 curries. Each curry came with a huge amount of rice on the same plate. So not much curry in each plate. Wasted almost $100 here for nothing. Very disappointed!",1
"If you are looking for an authentic Indian food this is not a place. Ok @ best.",1
"Just....Meh. We ordered samosas southern curry and mango salad. The curry to rice ratio was completely out of proportion. You get mostly rice in your dish. The mango salad was lettuce with half defrosted frozen mango on top. It was inedible and not authentic. Nice place in concept but won’t go back.",1
"Jasmin Restaurant is really a good place to have a dinner or lunch with your family and friends. I was with my friends and they really loved the place. It was a great experience to spend a quality of time with my friends there. I would love to visit the place again and again in upcoming days and would recommend anyone who want to try best Indian foods.",0
"I really loved the food and the services they provide at Jasmin Restaurant. After a long time I finally got an experience to go and enjoy the foods that gave so much of an Indian taste. I would love to go again and next time I will take my family with me. Also would love to share my experience in my Facebook or social media so people would get a chance to get a better experience like I did. And I assure that they won’t be disappointed.",0
"I was really attracted by the decorations of the place and the customer service they provide. Workers are really friendly and would give you suggestions of the foods if you are confused to make an order as they have too many to choose from. Manager was really nice and would love to get suggestions from customers.",0
"I had butter chicken which is my favorite Indian dish and this is now my favorite place to eat it. The sauce had a much more prominent tomato flavor than most other places which was extremely Pleasant. I'm capable of dealing with some fairly hot stuff but the medium was perfect for me. When I showed up there was hardly anybody in the restaurant oh and by the time I left every seat was filled predominantly with Indian people so you know the food is good and authentic. The garlic naan was not just plain naan with a little garlic salt on it  this had tons of garlic and it was wonderful. You know exactly who the clientele is when you see the cricket match playing on the TV. I will definitely have to come back for the buffet.",1
"We go here all the time. It's our favorite Indian place in Lubbock. The food is very flavorful and juicy",1
"IF YOU ARE READING THIS... YES EAT HERE!!",1
"One of the best restaurants I have ever been. Food is really great and services are good. Servers are very friendly and would come to check in every 5 minutes. I would love to come back with my friends and my family. They surely likes the place.",0
"This place has given a shame to a pride of a country. I have been to 100s of Indian Restaurants and have encountered some good and some bad restaurants. But this restaurant is out of my mind. I do not even have a word to show my anger through this review. Go yourself and I tell you that you will regret for being there and start hating yourself rest of your life.",0
"I am ashamed of my friends to give them a treat to this restaurant. I found this place while I searched for Indian Restaurant near me and had a good review. But when I went there I could not find even 10% of good things that were included in the ratings. I tell you do not risk yourself to go to this place.",0
"Thank me later as I am about to save your money. I will tell you give your money to poor or loose it by getting stupid stuff rather than spending here. Try yourself at home you will make foods better even if it is your first time. I might sue by spending 100s of dollars to get my $25 back. It’s worse than worse than worse.",0
"Very authentic peaceful atmosphere. Polite patrons and wonderful food at a very modest price. Been in business for many years and always professional. Perfect compliance with health codes.",1
"Very bad experience. Food was really bad I ordered lamb biriyani on door dash. They delivered beef biriyani instead. And rice and flavor was very bad.",1
"Worst possible food stinky place not fresh high price",1
"had a horrible experience. had to wait so long. no wonder we were the only customer. the furnitures are from 1925. disgusting decor. Most importantly food is horrible. Samosa not authentic. probably bought frozen. kebab same issue. tandoori is a joke the old Punjabi guy was doing all the job maybe also cooking or rather heating.",1
"I love Indian food. I’ve traveled all over and tried many restaurants. #roserestaurant has great food.. it is order at the counter and table served with very friendly servers. Have visited twice and both time Delicious! #naannation",1
"Amazing food and the owners are so sweet. Great family atmosphere amazing food and the staff are so friendly. Highly recommend the butter masala and shack naan. Amazing comfort food I with a kick. ❤️",1
"I am a really picky eater and I love this place! Just me that means a lot. The curry with some garlic naan is what I crave most days. I come twice a week just about. The atmosphere is very modern and accommodating and I’ve never not seen a warm smile on a staff member! Best part: there are more than one vegan option!! That’s huge for me and a competitive advantage for the restaurant!",1
"My wife and I eat here like twice a week. We love it. The food is consistently good and the people who work here are great. Service is fast and friendly. Prices are awesome for how good the food is. My only gripe is that there is always a TON of rice in the tikka masala dish and not enough sauce. I end up scraping half of the rice out first thing after I get my food",1
"The prices are a food is cheaper for most meals and the service is consistently pleasant and attentive. The chief advantage of this restraurant is its amazing meals. I would  choose Tikka and also Tikka's buffet is superior.",0
"I usually go for buffet.The food was excellent. Very flavorful and tasted ""fresh"". I only eat vegetarian but my friend eats meat and he thought the meat dishes were excellent as well as the vegetarian. The staff was the most friendly of any Indian restaurant I have been to - anywhere. The prices are competitive and I am looking forward to going back ASAP! Highly recommend! I've been to Jasmin Restaurant about 10 times by now. And every time it's been consistently good.It is probably the only place that  I can consistently agree on. It's VERY vegetarian friendly. And the buffet is always SO GOOD! It's never been the same main entrees every time I go there.",0
"I'm a loyal fan of this place. The food here is definitely a notch above some of the Indian restaurants in the area and they are priced relatively well.Good buffet and prices are pretty reasonable. Service was first rate and while not high end a very pleasant and neat interior apperance - better than the strip mall would suggest.",0
"It's my fav and they make it pretty well. They go easy on spice even though I ask for hot every time. Once in awhile they get spice right. The price of food is reasonable and the place looks pretty good.It's not that busy in weekdays so you always find peace.",0
"I found Jasmin Restaurant shortly after moving back to Lubbock. I ate here for the lunch buffet twice before my husband arrived.When my husband got to Lubbock we ate dinner here his first night in town and then the next day we came back for the lunch buffet. The food is as good as the best Indian I have eaten. The flavors are subtle. The heat of the spices is just right. We ordered medium off the menu and it was mildly spicy. Next time we will take it up a notch. The service is friendly without being obtrusive. This is our favorite restaurant in Lubbock.",1
"We have had dinner there several times and the food has been awesome. Tried the buffet yesterday for lunch and loved it....food was hot and the naan was the best ever. Just wish I could do a buffet justice",1
"I came here with my friend and loved it. The service was great and the food was wonderful. The tikka chicken marsala and chicken biryani are always my go to dishes when I try a new Indian restaurant I was definitely not disappointing. Everything I tried were very flavorful and even though it was a buffet the food was hot. I will definitely be back!",1
"Excellent food and good people very family friendly environment if a bit long on the wait for food. The food was delicious and well made and I would eat there again ",1
"This restraurant have some issues. The food came out looking nothing like the pictures. I don't recommed anyone to go to this restraurant. I get sick each time I eat at this place.",0
"To be honest the open concept of this restraurant really makes noisy dining adventure. The food is really expensive then it supposed to be.I came in here about a week ago and I was really disappointed. I spent $50 on food and tip for my to-go order and we only got 3 items. The worst part is that I called ahead and they said my food would be ready in 15 minutes and when we got there we had to wait 45 minutes.",0
"Food was not bad but I was disappointed at the fact that we put no celery and sprouts and they put them in all of our fried rices! What if we had an allergy to them? What if we waited 1 hour for our food and couldn't even eat it due to this!",0
"Waiting 45 minutes for a tiny box of fried rice and 4 dumplings that looked like they came from the supermarket. It wasn't even busy. Price was 18 dollars. Maybe it was 20. I just don't feel like there is anything special. Good but not WOW.",0
"I just had the most incredible Murgh tikke mahkani (sp?) plus vegetable samosas. The owner is the nicest man and prepared the dish perfectly. I don’t live in Lubbock anymore but I always stop by for a meal anytime I’m in town. Best place in west Texas for Indian food.",1
"We went to this restaurant on a Wednesday night around 7 PM. There was no customers and we had to holler to get the staff's attention. The first table we sat at was dirty so we moved a different table. It too was dirty. We asked the waiter to clean it which he did. When he brought the utensils we noticed that they were also dirty as well as the sugar container. At that point we left the restaurant without ordering any food. It was a shame that the owners would allow their restaurant to be in such a terrible state.",1
"Ordered Chicken biryani and chilly chicken. Absolutely enjoyed the taste and quality of the food. Chilly chicken was way too spicy even though I said medium level spicy. Worth the place to have Indian food. Shall try the buffet soon after I am back to city.",1
"My family and I began dining with Mr. Pal circa 1998 and were impressed with his genuine kindness and attentive manners. The atmosphere is definitely not West Texas nor fancy. The interior decor reflects many of the Indian traditions and culture. Parking is convenient. Everyone is greeted promptly and made comfortable. Our children learned about Indian food and appreciated Mr. Pal's gracious instruction. I loved the various types of nan and lamb dishes which we always ordered extra spicy. I highly recommend Gloria Restaurant and wish we had as good a Indian restaurant in our area!",1
"Samosa was not tasty at all. It was very plain and flat. It lacked main ingredients and spices which made it gross. And employee  seemed very busy but I said hi and told her 2 for dinner please so she stopped what she was doing and sat us. The food is ok. I felt it lacked the spices and flavor that I love in restaurant Indian food. On another note the restaurant was packed so not everyone agrees with my opinion.",0
"I'm not sure if the food would be categorized as Indian food. Fish amritsari was horrible.Bones bones bones in the chicken. Not a fan of the flavor for the price. Also VERY thick Naan which is the first I've ever had like that. Not returning.",0
"The restroom of this restraurant is dirty. It looks like they haven't clean this for a year. The lighting is dim the decor subdued and restaurant mostly quiet. Food is a bit pricey. Don't get the lamb phall. It's not just a spicy curry - it's over spiced with no salt. Rice was ok. Naan was too doughy (undercooked). Kinda disappointed",0
"Food was very disappointing and even customer service very bad. I hate the attitude of waiter who work here. I Tried quite a bit in the menu and nothing stands out aside from the dhal ghost that was ordered hot and came witout a hint of chilli.",0
